                        <h2>My Bio</h2>
                        <p>I'm a frontend developer driven by a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and
                            user-centric web experiences. My journey into tech started with a deep curiosity for how
                            things work, and it has evolved into a career where I can blend creativity with
                            problem-solving to build amazing things for the web.</p>

                        <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
                        <p>During the HNG internship, my primary goal is to sharpen my full-stack development skills. I
                            aim to master modern frameworks, contribute effectively to team projects, and build a
                            portfolio of work that demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world challenges from concept
                            to deployment.</p>

                        <h2>Areas to Improve</h2>
                        <p>While I'm comfortable with the frontend, I'm actively working to improve my confidence in
                            backend architecture and database management. I'm focusing on understanding data structures,
                            API design, and security best practices to become a more well-rounded developer.</p>

                            stop learning, and continue to build things that you're proud of. The journey is just as
                            important as the destination."</p>

                        <p>I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration and open-source. I find immense value in
                            learning from others and sharing knowledge. I'm excited to connect with fellow developers
